## üõ°Ô∏è Reflection  
Throughout this course, I learned that strong security must be built into software from the very beginning, not added as a final step. Secure coding standards create consistency and help reduce vulnerabilities before they reach production.

Risk analysis helped me understand that not every threat carries the same weight. Balancing severity, likelihood, and remediation costs helps prioritize what matters most while still protecting users.

Zero trust reshaped how I think about security. It reminds me that no user or system should be assumed safe without verification. Strong authentication, authorization, and auditing are necessary to protect sensitive data and maintain trust.

Policies are what tie all secure practices together. They set expectations for developers and ensure systems remain safe over time. Moving forward, I plan to continue writing code with security in mind, testing and auditing systems thoroughly, and incorporating best practices that protect both the organization and its users.
